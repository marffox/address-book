# Address-book SPA

## Node version: 5.12.0
## Nmp version: 3.8.6

## Description

For this application, I have used angular as framework, Typescript, sass for styling, webpack as module bundler and also bootstrap-sass to setup a base structure for layouts. In adition to this, I used a linter for Typescript and third-party libraries such as UUID to generate random id when creating a contact and country-list to provide a list of all countries.

Just follow the next steps and enjoy ;)
